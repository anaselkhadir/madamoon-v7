 * et c'est délibéré — traduire le ton demandait plus d'attention que

  O: [
    {
      q: "Which wedding dress cut should I choose for an O shape?",
      r: "Fluid falls and A-line cuts first: the fabric comes down in one piece and the line looks longer. The neckline counts as much as the cut — a V or a sweetheart opens the bust and lengthens the neck.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I wear a mermaid dress with an O shape?",
      r: "Yes. A body shape forbids no dress, it only says where to begin. The mermaid asks for a fabric that holds — a crêpe rather than a light satin — and is judged far better in the fitting room than in a photograph.",
    },
    {
      q: "Should I avoid ball gowns with an O shape?",
      r: "No, and the word “avoid” has no currency here. A worked bodice carries the eye upward, and the fullness of the skirt answers the bust without loading it. The ball gown simply comes after the sheath and the A-line in the order of fittings.",
    },
  ],
  A: [
    {
      q: "Which wedding dress suits an A shape best?",
      r: "The ones that give the upper body something to hold the eye: an embroidered or draped bodice, or a neckline that widens the shoulder. The skirt has nothing to prove — flared, it answers the hips without underlining them.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I balance hips that are broader than my shoulders?",
      r: "From above, never by covering below. A boat neckline or a straight bodice add a few centimetres of line at the shoulder, and that is enough to change the whole proportion.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does a mermaid dress suit an A shape?",
      r: "It wears very well, provided the top has something to balance it: a sleeve, a wide strap, a worked neckline. Many A-shape brides leave with a mermaid they had not planned to try on.",
    },
  ],
  V: [
    {
      q: "Which wedding dress for broad shoulders?",
      r: "The ones that build nothing above: a fluid fall starting at the bust, or a full skirt that gives the lower half the room it does not naturally have. The line balances by itself.",
    },
    {
      q: "Which neckline should I choose with a V shape?",
      r: "A V, a crossed or an asymmetric one. All three break the width with a vertical stroke, and here that is the detail that counts most — more than the cut of the skirt.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I wear puff sleeves with a V shape?",
      r: "Yes, and it can work very well if the skirt has volume to answer it. Worn over a straight skirt, the puff sleeve does emphasise the width of the shoulder — it is a question of balance, not of prohibition.",
    },
  ],
  H: [
    {
      q: "How do I create curves with an H shape?",
      r: "By letting the cut draw them. A light mermaid, a model fitted at the waist or a simple belt mark where you want, without gripping anything.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does the empire cut suit an H shape?",
      r: "Very well. It raises the waist under the bust and lengthens everything that follows. It deserves a fitting even if the idea did not appeal in a photograph — it is a cut you understand once it is on.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do I have to mark the waist?",
      r: "No. A straight dress, in clean satin, on a long figure, is one of the finest choices there is. Marking the waist is an option, not a correction to be made.",
    },
  ],
  "8": [
    {
      q: "Which wedding dress for a marked waist and curves?",
      r: "Mermaids and sheaths, which follow a line already in proportion without having to create it. Minimalist satin works for the same reason: it tells only the cut.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does a ball gown suit an 8 shape?",
      r: "Yes. The bodice nips in at the waist and the fullness starts from there: the contrast is clear, and that is the whole effect. It simply asks for room — think of the place and of the day.",
    },
    {
      q: "Should I avoid straight cuts with an 8 shape?",
      r: "No. A straight cut sometimes floats where the waist hollows, but a belt or a seam taken in at the waist settles the question in one fitting. Nothing is ruled out in advance.",
    },
  ],
  X: [
    {
      q: "Which wedding dress should I choose for an X shape?",
      r: "Almost every cut suits you — that is the honest answer. Mermaid, ball gown, sheath or minimalist: the question becomes one of the style of the wedding, not of the body shape.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I choose when every cut works?",
      r: "By the place, the season, and what you want to be able to do with your day. A two-metre train on a beach, heavy satin in August: the dress has to last twelve hours, not only the photograph.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is the X shape the same as the 8 shape?",
      r: "They resemble each other and are often confused. Both have shoulders and hips in balance; the 8 has frankly marked curves, the X softer curves and a fine waist. The advice overlaps a great deal, and both pages are worth reading.",
    },
  ],
